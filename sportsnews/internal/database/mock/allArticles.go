		Content:     "<p>- Huddersfield Towns support Love Football, Protect The Game<br>- Ensure football remains safe and enjoyable for all<br>- Dangerous acts have no place in football</p>\n<p><strong>Ahead of the start of the new season we want to make you aware of new measures being taken across all of football to help ensure football remains safe and enjoyable for all.</strong></p>\n<p>We are backing the introduction of strong measures across the professional and grassroots game to help improve the behaviour of players, managers and coaches on the pitch, and aiming to address the unacceptable issue of football tragedy abuse in the stands.</p>\n<p>Under the new participant charter match officials will be empowered to take more robust action, while the players will receive cards for any confrontation, surrounding or invasion of the match officials&rsquo; personal space. Our academy scholars will also undertake refereeing courses to improve players&rsquo; education into officiating.</p>\n<p>To challenge the totally unacceptable presence of football tragedy abuse, for season 2023/24, regulation changes and tough new measures have been introduced which will see people who are found guilty of offences face stadium bans and criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>This builds on measures to address dangerous and illegal crowd behaviour which were introduced last year and continue through the 2023/24 season including bans and reports to the police for activity such as entering the pitch without permission, carrying or using smoke bombs or pyrotechnics and throwing objects - as well as drug use and discriminatory behaviour.</p>\n<p>These acts are dangerous, illegal and have severe consequences. They have no place in football, or anywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Football should be a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone in the stadium whether on the pitch, on the line or in the stands. We thank you for your support this season.</strong></p>",

Match balls will be placed on cones in designated areas at pitch side to help increase the time of the ball being in play.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, clubs will no longer be permitted to use towels or other articles, including items obtained from spectators, to dry footballs during matches.</p>\n<p>Finally, match officials will take a new approach to time keeping this coming season. In line with the most recent IFAB guidance, the EFL and PGMOL are committed to ensure a more accurate calculation of additional time alongside an improvement in the amount of time the ball is in-play from the start of the new season.</p>\n<p>Read about all of the changes in full by <a href=\"https://www.efl.com/news/2023/july/28/-match-officials-adopt-new-approach-for-2023-24-season/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CLICKING HERE</strong></a> to visit the EFL website.</p>\n<p><strong>2023/24 Town Season Cards are back on sale! <a href=\"https://www.htafc.com/tickets/202324-season-cards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CLICK HERE</a> to guarantee your place alongside us at the John Smith's Stadium this season!</strong></p>",

He's contributed enormously this pre-season.</p>\n<p>\"A couple of the lads, I don't think they're far away. David isn't too bad, but Leesy and Jonathan Hogg will be back on the grass soon.</p>\n<p>\"Tom and Hoggy are big in what we do, they're important around the place. I'm really pleased with the senior lads if I'm honest.</p>\n<p>\"Helik has improved while we've been here, you can't tell me there's a better centre-half in this league.</p>\n<p>\"We've had to have one or two words, but he's always listened and responded and that's to his credit.</p>\n<p>\"Edwards has fit straight in, and Maxwell would get in most Championship sides I think.</p>\n<p>\"They're just like us, and that's what we want with us.</p>\n<p>\"I'm aware of social media and what they'll be saying and panicking about signings, but I won't be reading that this season.</p>\n<p>\"I also know most of our fans who love the Club don't do social media, so I'm managing as much for them as I am anyone else.</p>\n<p>\"It'll be a good atmosphere on Saturday, it's so good to see Plymouth back up at this level.</p>\n<p>\"I do hope to see them do well, just after Saturday of course!</p>\n<p>\"I always think when you've got injuries, it gives somebody an opportunity.</p>\n<p>\"For me this pre-season Ben Jackson has surprised me the most, in the training and in matches, he's really stood out to me. He's a fantastic boy as well.</p>\n<p>\"Hudlin has been a big surprise too, and Kian has stepped up and looks like scoring every time he plays too.</p>\n<p>\"Wardy and Josh Koroma know my expectations, Sorba I want to see more involved in the box and Jack Rudoni is more than capable of scoring 10 himself too.\"</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DWMFDGur1LI\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" title=\"YouTube video player\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>There is less than 10 days to go until we kick-off our 2023/24 Sky Bet Championship season off at the John Smith&rsquo;s Stadium! <a href=\"https://www.htafc.com/tickets/202324-season-cards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CLICK HERE</a> to secure your Season Card to guarantee the best value for money while supporting your Terriers.</strong></p>",

		Content:     "<p>- Plymouth Argyle 3-1 Huddersfield Town<br>- Michał Helik scores the Town goal<br>- Wasteful finishing and defensive errors costs Town</p>\n<p><strong>Town started the 2023/24 Sky Bet Championship season with defeat at newly promoted Plymouth Argyle in a game that could have easily gone the other way if it wasn&rsquo;t for some poor finishing.</strong></p>\n<p>Having fallen behind early after a moment of defensive hesitation put them, Neil Warnock&rsquo;s side deservedly got back in it through Michał Helik to draw level at the interval. However, it could &ndash; and should &ndash; have been more, with Josh Koroma and Jack Rudoni missing very presentable chances.</p>\n<p>Brahima Diarra couldn&rsquo;t capitalise on another big moment before the hosts scored a quickfire brace to put the game beyond date, albeit with the third having more of a hint of offside.</p>\n<p>Neil Warnock set his side up in a 4-3-3 formation for the season opener, with new loan signing Tom Edwards being handed an immediate debut at right back in front of more than 1,600 vocal Town fans.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, a moment of indecision cost Town only six minutes in as the hosts took the lead. Bali Mumba&rsquo;s cross from our right was headed into the air and two of our best, Lee Nicholls and Michał Helik, left the ball for each other. Eventually the Pole reacted and headed it partially clear, but a Plymouth man knocked it back into the six-yard box where winger Morgan Whittaker bundled it home.</p>\n<p>Buoyed, the newly promoted team in green tried to push on and went close to a second. Callum Wright turned Rarmani Edmonds-Green too easily in midfield and advanced before playing the ball into the box for Whittaker, who forced Nicholls into a low save by his near post.</p>\n<p>Town got a foothold in the game on the quarter hour and started to create at the other end. On two occasions Josh Koroma seized upon passes from goalkeeper Conor Hazard, but we couldn&rsquo;t take advantage. On the first occasion he found Danny Ward in the area, who rolled a shot from a narrow angle well wide. On the second, he trued to shoot himself and smashed the ball wildly high and wide.</p>\n<p>The men in blue and white continued forward and Edmonds-Green soon supplied Koroma again down the left. He cut inside in trademark fashion and took aim, but midfielder Jordan Houghton bravely took the powerful effort full in the face.</p>\n<p>JK was the main threat on the pitch at this point and should have done much better in the 23rd minute when Sorba Thomas&rsquo; deep cross fell to him in space at the back post. He tried to bluff the &lsquo;keeper and fire inside the near post but dragged his effort wide from around 15 yards out.</p>\n<p>Warnock was forced into a change as the game continued, as Matty Pearson was unable to recover from what looked like a dead leg sustained in an aerial challenge with the Plymouth &lsquo;keeper. That accelerated club captain Jonathan Hogg&rsquo;s return from injury, as he came off the bench and REG dropped into centre back.</p>\n<p>Jack Rudoni had the next effort but could only send a header from Edwards&rsquo; excellent cross miles wide in the swirling wind at Home Park.</p>\n<p>With first half added time ticking down, Town managed to find the equaliser that they deserved. A corner was initially cleared out of the area by Argyle, but Town kept it alive and worked it to Sorba on the right. His left footed cross wasn&rsquo;t properly cleared at the near post and Brahima Diarra outmuscled a defender to seize the ball before hitting a snapshot that cannoned off the near post, with the ball flying straight to Helik, who stroked it home!</p>\n<p>Town took that momentum into the second 45 minutes and, with the wind at their backs, looked the more likely side to go ahead. Diarra&rsquo;s swirling cross had to be tipped over by Hazard early on and then, shortly afterwards, the same player forced the Plymouth &lsquo;keeper into an error in possession. Brahima picked up the ball in the area and span to shoot, and should have done better; in the end, Hazard managed to push his shot wide.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, a loss of two individual battles cost Town. Plymouth retook the lead in the 73rd minute when Mumba got past Thomas on the wing and then drove straight through the heart of the Town defence before beating Nicholls inside the area.</p>\n<p>Diarra half volleyed just wide from 20 yards after good work from Ward and Rudoni right after the restart, but then Plymouth scored a third as striker Ryan Hardie went clear and beat Nicholls. There was more than a hint of offside about the goal, when looking at the replay, but it stood.</p>\n<p>Substitute Pat Jones tried to get his side back in it upon the restart, skinning his full back before finding Ward at the near post. However, this time Hazard did well &ndash; sticking out a hand to deflect his deft near post effort over the crossbar.</p>\n<p>Town couldn&rsquo;t create another clear-cut chance as Argyle saw the game out, meaning defeat on the road for the Terriers.</p>\n<p><strong>Town&rsquo;s team vs Plymouth Argyle (4-3-3)</strong><br>Lee Nicholls; Tom Edwards, Matty Pearson (Jonathan Hogg, 42&rsquo;), Michał Helik (c), Josh Ruffels; Jack Rudoni, Rarmani Edmonds-Green, Brahima Diarra (Pat Jones, 77&rsquo;); Sorba Thomas (Ben Jackson, 77&rsquo;), Danny Ward, Josh Koroma (Kian Harratt, 84&rsquo;)</p>\n<p><strong>Unused substitutes</strong><br>Chris Maxwell; Jaheim Headley, Brodie Spencer, Kyle Hudlin, Yuta Nakayama</p>\n<p><strong>Town booking</strong><br>Michał Helik (45+8&rsquo;)</p>",

Trialist Toluwa Junaid did well to keep the ball in on the touchline and found midfielder Temi Okuwa, who spread play to the right for winger Aaron Ojungu. He drove forward and then infield before passing to first year scholar Oliver Calland, who moved the ball into the area for Bakre; he touch one touch before firing past the goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>Mansfield were awarded three penalties in the game, the first coming two minutes after the Town opener when trialist Isaac Acquah brought down a winger from behind. However, Hurl did brilliantly, flinging himself to his left to claw the ball away before a free kick was awarded.</p>\n<p>The visitors missed a point-blank header before Town scored their second in the 38th minute. Acquah did well to win a corner on our left side and when captain Dylan Helliwell delivered the set piece into the box, Gregory (pictured above) rose highest to nod the ball towards goal, with it cannoning in off a defender.</p>\n<p>Hurl made several good saved as the game continued, whilst Bakre went close to a second with a snapshot at the other end.</p>\n<p>It was Mansfield who reduced the arrears with around 20 minutes left, with another trialist inadvertently putting a Mansfield player clear with a tackle in midfield and that playing finally beating Hurl.</p>\n<p>Mansfield&rsquo;s second penalty was awarded soon after when a trialist made a clumsy challenge, but this time the spot kick was fired over.</p>\n<p>However, the referee offered a slightly harsh looking third in added time when Freddie Fletcher was adjudged to have blocked a shot with his arm, from which he was shown a straight red card. This time Mansfield did convert.</p>\n<p>Town&rsquo;s B Team is back in action on Monday evening, travelling to the north east to take on Sunderland at the Academy of Light.</p>\n<p><strong>Town&rsquo;s team (4-2-3-1)</strong><br>Francis Hurl; Omari Mrisho, Freddie Fletcher, Anthony Gregory, Isaac Acquah; Dylan Helliwell (c), Temi Okuwa; Aaron Ojungu, Oliver Calland (Israel Ajana, 46&rsquo;), Toluwa Junaid; Hazeem Bakre (Alieu Kebe, 66&rsquo;)</p>\n<p><strong>Unused substitute</strong><br>Alex Walpole</p>",

The young forward was in the right place at the right time as Josh Austerfield collected an errant ball out of defence and sent it to Harratt in the centre of the box; he fired the ball into the back of the net.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Jaheim Headley was shown a red card in the 13th minute for denying Isaiah Jones a clear goal scoring opportunity, who was played through on goal as he tried to find the equaliser &ndash; Town were down to 10 men.</p>\n<p>This was closely followed by another chance for our visitors to equalise after a long range shot from Daniel Barlaser went just wide of the goal, but our &lsquo;keeper had it covered and went the right way to make the save if he was needed to.</p>\n<p>Middlesbrough got their equaliser in the 20th minute through Sammy Silvera; he cut around Brodie Spencer and hit the ball off the near post, it then went across the back of Maxwell and into the back of the nett off the far post.</p>\n<p>Town were awarded a corner in the 27th minute after Harratt&rsquo;s shot from the centre of the box was knocked out after great play between Jordan Rhodes and Brahima Diarra &ndash; the corner was taken by Ben Jackson and fell amongst the Terriers in the box, but nobody could get a clear shot on target.</p>\n<p>Rhodes was then fouled by Hayden Coulsen outside the box, so a free kick was awarded to Town. Yuta Nakayama stood over the free-kick and took it direct; his shot was low and was headed on target, but this was anticipated well by Tom Glover, and he scooped the ball up.</p>\n<p>Shortly after this, Harratt received the ball inside the box, but he couldn&rsquo;t get a clear shot on target, so he sent the ball to Diarra, who was unmarked on the edge of the box, but his shot was saved low in the centre of the goal.</p>\n<p>In the last minute of extra time in the first half, Nakayama forced Glover to put the ball out for a corner after he ran onto the ball in the box and fired it towards the goal. Both sides went into the second half with everything to play for.</p>\n<p>Maxwell made a great save at the beginning of the second half and denied Morgan Rogers the chance to take the lead after he had done well to spin in the box away from his man.</p>\n<p>Not long after this, Austerfield is in a great position as he headed back towards his own goal and cut out a low cross across the six-yard box.</p>\n<p>Boro&rsquo;s second goal came in the 64th minute as Isaiah Jones was played onside at close range and then chipped the ball into the back of the net &ndash; multiple Town players went to clear it off the line but couldn&rsquo;t get there in time.</p>\n<p>Our visitors final goal came in the 82nd minute through second half substitute Riley McGree as he carried the ball into the box and then found the back of the net as Diarra came for the tackle.</p>\n<p>However, Town managed to get another goal back before the final whistle &ndash; four minutes after coming off the bench, Kyle Hudlin scored through a diving header from close range into the far post from a Pat Jones cross, but this was one of the final pieces of play and Town&rsquo;s Cup run is over.</p>\n<p><strong>Town&rsquo;s Team (4-3-2-1)</strong><br>Chris Maxwell; Brodie Spencer, Loick Ayina, Yuta Nakayama (Connor Mahoney, 86&rsquo;), Jaheim Headley; Ben Jackson, Jonathan Hogg (c) (Scott High, 46&rsquo;), Josh Austerfield; Jordan Rhodes (Pat Jones, 63&rsquo;), Brahima Diarra (Rarmani Edmonds-Green, 63&rsquo;); Kian Harratt (Kyle Hudlin, 89&rsquo;)</p>\n<p><strong>Unused Subs</strong> <br>Lee Nicholls, Josh Ruffels, Josh Koroma, Sorba Thomas</p>\n<p><strong>Goal Scorers</strong><br>Kian Harratt (4'), Kyle Hudlin (90+4')</p>\n<p><strong>Red Card</strong> <br>Jaheim Headley (13')</p>",

His formidable, uncompromising style made him a fan favourite during his 12 years of dedicated service to the club.</p>\n<p>Born in Worksop in 1937, John played for Worksop Boys Club before joining Town in 1953 shortly after leaving school in Shirebrook; a school that future teammate Ray Wilson also attended. John signed as a part-timer in 1955 and soon made his debut in the difficult 1955/56 season against Manchester United at Old Trafford.</p>\n<p>After a spell on National Service, John returned and signed a full-time contract in 1958, aged 21 and immediately became a regular in the side. Known for being dominant in the air and nearly impossible to knock off the ball, he was a first choice of manager Bill Shankly. In fact, he barely missed a game over the next eight seasons in the Second Division and was named captain by the following manager, Eddie Boot.</p>\n<p>John&rsquo;s teammates included Denis Law, the aforementioned Wilson, Kevin McHale and even Frank Worthington, amid many other famous names in our history.</p>\n<p>John was also given the responsibility of being penalty taker, and most of his 18 goals for Town came from the spot.</p>\n<p>His time at Town eventually ended in 1967. John spent three years with Blackburn Rovers before a move to Stockport County, and after hanging up his boots he was chief coach for Bradford City and Middlesbrough.</p>\n<p>John currently stands 13th in our all-time appearance list, behind former teammate Les Massie and just ahead of current club captain Jonathan Hogg.</p>\n<p>John&rsquo;s grandson, Luke, a goalkeeper, also played for Town at Academy level in the 2016/17 season.</p>\n<p>Our thoughts are with Luke, John's son Matty and the rest of John&rsquo;s family, and friends, at this difficult time. </p>",

Winners will be announced at the Awards Ceremony on Thursday 14 September 2023 at the Royal Lancaster Hotel, London.</p>\n<p>Hosted by broadcaster and menopause champion Louise Minchin, 350 guests will attend in person while hundreds more will join via live link from across the country.</p>\n<p>Organised by <a href=\"https://menopausefriendly.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Henpicked: Menopause in the Workplace</a>, the Menopause Friendly Employer Awards is also an important fundraiser, aiming to raise &pound;100,000 for a range of menopause-related charities, programmes, and research.</p>\n<p>The Awards have attracted a wealth of menopause friendly members keen to sponsor the categories and tables. Taking their place alongside the headline sponsors are Accenture, BAE Systems, Boots and No7 Beauty Company, Bristol Myers Squibb, British Airways, Lloyds Banking Group, Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, Theramex and Vitabiotics.</p>\n<p>The Menopause Friendly Employer Awards were judged by the Menopause Friendly Independent Panel who were looking particularly for the impact achieved within the workplace.</p>\n<p>Town have been shortlisted in the Most Supportive Partner category, which saw excellent practice demonstrated by very different organisations ranging from sport to third sector. All clearly cared deeply about not only ensuring their own workplace is menopause friendly but also actively encouraging others to do the same. There were some great examples of reaching professional partners and organisations across their communities in innovative ways designed to resonate with them, break down barriers and provide meaningful support.</p>\n<p><strong>The finalists in the Most Supportive Partner category are:</strong><br>Derby County Community Trust<br>Huddersfield Town Association Football Club <br>University of Greenwich</p>\n<p><strong>Zoe Shackleton, our HR Manager and Equality Lead, commented:</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re absolutely delighted to have been shortlisted for this award for the second year in a row. Being a supportive partner is about sharing best practice and helping other organisations to develop a menopause friendly culture in their own environment.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have worked with many companies in the past 12 months, and it has been hugely rewarding to play a part in the work they are developing to put women&rsquo;s wellbeing needs at the top of their agenda.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This nomination is a testament to the hard work of many members of staff at Huddersfield Town, who work tirelessly to maintain the momentum of our menopause friendly journey and ensure that our football club and other workplaces are as inclusive and welcoming of everyone as possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Deborah Garlick, CEO of Henpicked: Menopause in The Workplace commented:</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;The standard of this year&rsquo;s Awards entries has been phenomenal &ndash; employers have significantly raised the bar in terms of their creativity, innovative approach and, importantly, making a positive impact in their workplace.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Independent Panel had such a tough job selecting the finalists from a very strong field of entrants &ndash; they even had to take the judging into a second day, due to the high number of entries and the extraordinary level of detail they were given to assess.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I congratulate all our finalists: you really are the best of the best. And my thanks go to everyone for their complete commitment to being menopause friendly. There is remarkable work being undertaken by employers and individuals whose dedication is changing hearts and minds to improve people&rsquo;s lived experience of menopause in the workplace.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>To find out more visit: </strong><a href=\"https://menopausefriendly.co.uk/awards/\"><strong>https://menopausefriendly.co.uk/awards/</strong></a></p>",
